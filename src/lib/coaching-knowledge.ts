    "5km": `
**5KM SPECIALIST KNOWLEDGE (Jack Daniels / Pfitzinger Influence)**
- **Physiology**: 90-95% Aerobic, but requires high VO2 Max and Lactate Threshold.
- **Key Workouts**: 
    - *VO2 Max Intervals*: 400m-1km reps at 3k-5k pace (Crucial for speed).
    - *Tempo Runs*: 20-30 mins at threshold (roughly 15-20s/km slower than 5k pace) to build stamina.
    - *Long Run*: Capped at 10-14km. Over-distance is good but speed is king.
- **Taper**: Short 1-week taper. Reduce volume by 30-50%, keep intensity high (sharp) until 2 days before.
- **Strategy**: Aggressive pacing. The "pain cave" starts at 3km.
`,
    "10km": `
**10KM SPECIALIST KNOWLEDGE**
- **Physiology**: Highly aerobic but requires the ability to suffer at threshold.
- **Key Workouts**:
    - *Cruise Intervals*: 1km-1.6km reps at Threshold pace with short rest.
    - *Long Intervals*: 5-6 x 1km at 5k pace to build speed endurance.
    - *Long Run*: 12-16km. Needs to feel comfortable.
- **Taper**: 7-10 days. Slow decay in volume. Maintain frequency.
- **Strategy**: Control the first 5km, race the second 5km. Negative splits are common for PRs.
`,
    "Half Marathon": `
**HALF MARATHON SPECIALIST KNOWLEDGE (Hanson / Pfitz)**
- **Physiology**: A test of pure lactate threshold and aerobic efficiency.
- **Key Workouts**:
    - *Tempo Runs*: The "Bread and Butter". Extended efforts (6-10km) at Goal Marathon Pace or slightly faster.
    - *Progression Long Runs*: 16-22km finishing fast.
    - *Speed*: Less importance on pure VO2 max, more on "Comfortably Hard".
- **Taper**: 2 weeks. Week 1: 70% volume. Week 2: 40% volume.
- **Strategy**: Don't bank time. Even splits are the most efficient. Fueling practice starts becoming relevant.
`,
    "Full Marathon": `
**MARATHON SPECIALIST KNOWLEDGE (Pfitzinger / Kipchoge Elements)**
- **Physiology**: Glycogen storage, fat oxidation, and muscular endurance.
- **Key Workouts**:
    - *The Long Run*: 24-34km. Time on feet is critical.
    - *Marathon Pace (MP)*: Blocks of 10-15km at Goal Pace within a daily run.
    - *Recovery*: Recovery runs are NOT "junk miles", they stimulate blood flow and adapation.
- **Taper**: 3 weeks (The "Pfitz 18/55" standard).
    - 3 Weeks out: 70% volume.
    - 2 Weeks out: 60% volume.
    - Race Week: 30% volume + strides.
- **Strategy**: The race starts at 32km (20 miles). The first 30km is a commute. Fueling is mandatory (60g carbs/hr).

export const REALITY_CHECK_RULES = `
**REALITY CHECK RULES**:
1. **The 10% Rule**: Never increase weekly volume by more than 10-15% week-over-week.
2. **Frequency**: 
   - Beginner: 3-4 runs/week.
   - Intermediate: 4-5 runs/week.
   - Advanced: 5-7 runs/week.
3. **The 'Long Run' Cap**: The long run should not exceed 30-35% of total weekly volume.
